# Haro-Toys

This is a collection of small projects that I have worked on. They are mostly toy projects that I have done to learn new things or to experiment with different ideas. The projects are organized into different categories based on the topic of the project.

## Taxonomy

- `math`: mathematical methods.
- `ml`: machine learning.
- `others`: other random stuff.

## List of projects

- [math-GP](math-GP/README.md): A simple implementation of a Bayesian optimizer based on gaussian process regression in python. To compare the performance of the bayesian optimizer, a simulated annealing optimizer and a genetic algorithm optimizer are also implemented.
