# math-GP

This is a simple implementation of a bayesian optimizer based on gaussian process regression in python. To compare the performance of the bayesian optimizer, a simulated annealing optimizer and a genetic algorithm optimizer are also implemented.

`report.pdf` contains the report of comparison of the three optimizers on some toy functions.
